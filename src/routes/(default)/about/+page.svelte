    chanting until we get hungry.

    Sunset Sundays at James Kreigh Park, at quarter-till-sunset we dance with
    the sunset and end with meditative music while lying on yoga mats
    watching the stars emerge. We call it a mini camping ecstatic dance trip.

    of Movement Tucson's Ecstatic-type Dance at Himmel Park, Sunday mornings
