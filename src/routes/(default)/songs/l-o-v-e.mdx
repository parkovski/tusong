```
 L,  is  for the way you  look at  me 
 O,  is for the only one I see
 V,  is very, very, extraordinary …
 E,  is even more than Anyone that you adore and

Love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it, 
take my heart but please don’t break it
Love was made for me and you. 
Love was made for me and you.
