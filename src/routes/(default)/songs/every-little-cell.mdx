title: Every Little Cell

```
Every little cell in my body is happy
Every little cell in my body is well  (2x) 
I’m so glad, every little cell in my body is happy and well. 2x

Every little thought in my mind is fleeting
Every little thought in my mind goes by  2x
I’m so glad, every little thought in my mind is really not. 2x
