title: Stand By Me
---

```
When the night has come, and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we’ll see
No, I won’t be afraid, Oh, I won’t be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh Stand by me.  Oh oh stand by me stand by me  
 
If the sky that we look upon, should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won’t cry, I won’t cry, No I won’t shed a tear, 
just as long as you stand by me

Oh darling darlin stand by me
Oh oh stand by me, stand by me stand by me stand by me
Whenever you’re in trouble, Won’t you stand by me
```
