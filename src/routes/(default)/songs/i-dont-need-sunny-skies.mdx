title: "I Don't Need Sunny Skies"
---

```
Hey there, duchess, don't you know
A little rain is gonna come and go
But I don't need sunny skies to sing about you.

I'm like the birds up in the trees
With an endless store of melodies
And I don't need sunny skies to sing about you.

I'd sing about your laughing eyes, the way they fill the room
The way you're lighting the sky upon this rainy afternoon

Aw, thanks for the flowers, thanks for the smile
I'm gonna sit and play my guitar for a while
I don't need sunny skies to sing about you.

I'd sing about your dancing feet, the way you jump and spin
The way you open the door and let this world waltz right on in

Hey there duchess, don't you know,
Here's a tune to say I love you so,
And I don't need sunny skies to sing about you, Oh... 3x
```
