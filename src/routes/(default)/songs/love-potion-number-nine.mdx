title: Love Potion Number Nine
---

```
I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth.
She’s got a pad down on thirty-fourth and Vine.
Sellin’ little bottles of: Love Potion Number Nine.

I told here that I was a flop with chics.
I’ve been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said What you need was : Love Potion Number Nine.

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I’m gonna make it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian Ink.
I held my nose and closed my eyes and I took a drink.

I didn’t know if it was day or night.
I started kissin’ every thing in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
She broke my little bottle of:  Love Potion number nine.
