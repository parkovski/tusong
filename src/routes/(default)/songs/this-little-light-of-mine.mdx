```
This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine	
This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine 
This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine
Let it shine Let it shine Let it shine
(All around the world; My brothers my sisters; 
This be love of ours;From my heart to yours; Hide it under a cactus; In darkness and light)
