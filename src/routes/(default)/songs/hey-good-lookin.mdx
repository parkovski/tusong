```
Hey Good Lookin' whatcha got cookin
How's about cookin somethin' up with me 
Hey sweet baby don't ya think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe 
 
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me
 
Say Hey Good Lookin' whatcha got cookin
How's about cookin somethin' up with me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How about saving all your time for me 
No more lookin' I know I've been tooken
How about keepin' steady company 
 
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents 
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page 
Say Hey Good Lookin' whatcha got cooking, 
Howâ€™s about cookin something up with me
```
