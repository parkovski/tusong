title: On the Sunny Side of the Street
---

```
Grab your coat, and get your hat, leave your worries on the 
Door-step. Just direct you feet to the Sunny side of the street

Can’t you hear a pitter pat, and that happy tune is your step. 
Life can be so sweet on the Sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade, 
But I’m not afraid, this rover crossed over. 

If I never have a cent, I’ll be rich as Rockefeller. 
Gold dust at my feet, on the Sunny side of the street.
```
