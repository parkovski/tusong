title: I Believe in Music
---

```
I could just sit around, making music all day long.
As long as I’m making my music ain’t gonna do nobody no harm
And who knows, maybe someday, I’ll come up with a song
To make people want to stop this fussing and fighting
Long enough to sing along. 

I believe in music.  I believe in love
I believe in music.  I believe in Love

Music is love and love is music If you know what I mean
People who believe in music are the happiest people I’ve ever seen
So clap you hands and stomp your feet and shake those tambourines
Lift your voices to the sky, God loves you when you sing.  I believe

Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To peace and hope and understanding, and living in harmony
So take your brother by the hand and come along with me
Find out what it really means to be rich and young and free I believe
