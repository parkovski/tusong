```
Don’t worry about a thing,
cause every little thing, gonna be all right. 
Singin, don’t worry about a thing
cause every little thing, gonna be all right.

Rise up this mornin, Smile with the risin sun,
Three little birds, sittin by my doorstep
Singin Sweet songs. Of melodies pure and true,
Sayin, This is my message to you
```
