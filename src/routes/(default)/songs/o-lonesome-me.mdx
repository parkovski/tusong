title: "O Lonesome Me"
---

```
Everybody's goin' out and havin' fun.
I'm just a fool for stayin' home and havin' none.
I can't get over how she set me free. Oh... lonesome me.

A bad mistake I'm makin' by just hanging 'round.
I know that I shoudl have some fun and paint the town.
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see. Oh, lonesome me.

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free,
flirting with the boys with all her charms.
But I still love her so, and brother don't you know,
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues.
Forget about the past and find somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z. Oh, lonesome me...
