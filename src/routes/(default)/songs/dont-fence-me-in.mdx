title: "Don't Fence Me In"
---

```
Oh give me land, lots of land under starry skies above, 
don’t fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide-open country that I love;
don’t fence me in. 
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze, 
listen to the mur-mur of the cottonwood trees.
send me off forever, but I ask you please, don’t fence me in.  
 
Just turn run me loose let me straddle my old saddle 
Underneath the western skies. 

On my cay-use, let me wander over yonder til I see the mountains rise--e.  

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences, 
gaze at the moon til I lose my senses,
can’t look at hobbles, and I can’t stand fences;   
don’t fence me in.
```
