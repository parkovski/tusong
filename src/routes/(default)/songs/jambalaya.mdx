```
Goodbye Joe me gotta go me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne the sweetest one me oh my oh
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun o the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filet gumbo
‘Cause tonight I’m gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin.
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, me on my oh
Son of me gun we’ll have big fun on the bayou
```
