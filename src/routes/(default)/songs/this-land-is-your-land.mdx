title: This Land Is Your Land
---

```
This land is your land, This land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
 This land was made for you and  me.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me.    CHORUS

I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
to the sparkling  sands of her diamond deserts
While all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and  me.   CHORUS

This land is your land, cont.
```
