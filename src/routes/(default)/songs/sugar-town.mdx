```
 I GOT SOME TROUBLES BUT THEY WON’T LAST
 I’M GONNA LAY RIGHT DOWN HERE IN THE GRASS
 AND PRETTY SOON ALL MY TROUBLES WILL PASS
 CAUSE I’M IN  SU…SU…SU. SU…SU…SU… SUSUSUSU SUGAR TOWN  OH!
 
I NEVER HAD A DOG THAT LIKED ME SOME
I NEVER HAD A FRIEND THAT WANTED ONE
SO I JUST LAY BACK AND LAUGH AT THE SUN
CAUSE I’M IN  SU SU… SU….SU… SU…   SUGAR TOWN  OH!

YESTER DAY IT RAINED IN TENNESSEE 
I HEARD IT ALSO RAINED IN TALLAHASEE
BUT NOT A DROP FELL ON LITTLE OLE ME
CAUSE I’M IN  SU… SU… SU….SU…SU… SUGAR TOWN    OH!

IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS OR TEN
I’d GIVE IT TO YOU WORLD AND THEN
YOU’D GO AWAY AND LET ME SPEND
MY LIFE IN SU…   SU…SU…………….SUGAR TOWN….OH!
