title: "Mental Floss"
---

```
I'd like to be a jellyfish 'cause jellyfish don't pay rent
They don't walk and they don't talk with some Euro-trash accent
They're just simple protoplasm clear as cellophane
They ride the winds of fortune, life without a brain

In one ear and out the other, don't you get criss-crossed
I recommend you try a little mental floss

It's the small, small problems, that keep me so upset
And send me seeking shelter beneath my mosquito net
I stay there for hours protected from the night
All those insects and vipers and other things that bite.
```
