title: "Sweet Happy Life"
---

```
My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all the days of the years that you live be laughing days.
With all my heart, sweet happy life
And may the night times that follow the days be dancing lights.

Stars for your smile, moons for your hair
And someone's wonderful love for your loving heart to share

My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing.
And if a wish can make it be,
I wish to spend every day of your happy life with me.
Sweet happy life, sweet happy life.
```
