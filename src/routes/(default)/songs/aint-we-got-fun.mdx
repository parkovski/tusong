title: "Ain't We Got Fun"
---

```
Every morning, every evening ain't we got fun?
Not much money, oh but honey ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid, dear we haven't car
but anyway dear we'll stay as we are.

Even if we owe the grocer, don't we have fun?
Tax collectors, getting closer. Still we have fun.
There's nothing surr-er,
the rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the mean time in between time don't we got fun?
```
