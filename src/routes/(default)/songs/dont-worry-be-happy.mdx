```
HERE’S A LITTLE SONG I WROTE YOU MIGHT WANT TO SING IT NOTE FOR NOTE.  DON’T WORRY,  BE HAPPY
IN EVERY LIFE WE HAVE SOME TROUBLE. 
WHEN YOU WORRY YOU MAKE IT DOUBLE.  DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY,LA LA

AIN’T GOT NO PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD
SOMEONE CAME AND TOOK YOUR BED   DON’T WORRY,  BE HAPPY
LANDLORD SAY YOU’RE RENT IS LATE. HE MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE.   DON’T WORRY,   BE HAPPY.  LA LA LA

AIN’T GOT NO CASH, AIN’T GOT NO STYLE
AIN’T GOT NO GAL TO MAKE YOU SMILE.  DON’T WORRY  BE HAPPY
CUZ WHEN YOU WORRY, YOU FACE WILL FROWN
AND THAT WILL BRING EVERYDODY DOWN.DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY. LA LA 
```
