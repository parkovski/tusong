title: "Tonight You Belong to Me"
---

```
I know you belong to somebody new
But tonight you belong to me.

Although we're apart, you're a part of my heart
And tonight you belong to me.

Way down by the stream; how sweet it would seem
Once more just to dream in the moon light

My honey I know with the dawn, that you will be gone
And tonight you belong to me,
Just to little ole me.
```
