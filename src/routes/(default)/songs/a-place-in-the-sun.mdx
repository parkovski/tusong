title: "A Place in the Sun"
---

```
Like a long lonely stream, I keep running towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree, I keep reaching to be free; movin' on, movin' on

Cos there's a place in the sun, where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
There's a place in the sun, and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road, I get weary from the load; movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired, troubled earth, I've been rollin' since my birth; movin' on, movin' on
```
