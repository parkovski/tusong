```
Oh! We ain’t got a bar-el of mon-ey,
Maybe we’re ragged and funny
But we’ll travel along singin a song, Side by Side

Don’t know what’s comin tomorrow, 
Maybe it’s trouble and sorrow
But we’ll travel the road, sharin our load. Side by Side

*Through all kinds of weather, 
what if the sky should fall
Just as long as we’re together, 
it really doesn’t matter at all

When they’ve all had their quarrels and parted.
Well be the same as we started.  
Just travelin along singing a song,  Side by side   
*Through all kinds of wheater...
