title: Little Bit of Love
---

```
All I need is a little sun, some for me some for every one
 All I need is a little air, some for me some for everywhere
 A Little Lo--ve,    Oh a Little Lo--ve,
Just a little lo--ve,  A little bit of lo--ve

All I need is some water to drink, 
a quiet place where I can sit & think
And if I find a pot of gold, I’ll never forget about the rainbow
 A Little Love,    Oh a Little Love,
 Just a little love,  A little bit of love

But really what I’m trying to say, is I need you
 And every little bit of love you give me too  oo

All I need is a happy home,some place I wouldn’t have to be alone
Well It’d be nice to have some candle light, 
to light the fire in your heart at night
  A Little L--ove,    Oh a Little Lo--ve,
  Just a little love,  A little bit of love
