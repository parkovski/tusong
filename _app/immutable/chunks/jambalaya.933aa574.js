My Yvonne the sweetest one me oh my oh
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun o the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filet gumbo
‘Cause tonight I’m gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun on the bayou

Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, me on my oh
