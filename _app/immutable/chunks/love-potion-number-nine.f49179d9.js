You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth.
She’s got a pad down on thirty-fourth and Vine.
Sellin’ little bottles of: Love Potion Number Nine.

I told here that I was a flop with chics.
I’ve been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said What you need was : Love Potion Number Nine.

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I’m gonna make it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian Ink.
I held my nose and closed my eyes and I took a drink.

I didn’t know if it was day or night.
I started kissin’ every thing in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
She broke my little bottle of:  Love Potion number nine.</code>`;return{c(){e=h("pre"),this.h()},l(t){e=u(t,"PRE",{class:!0});var n=m(e);n.forEach(o),this.h()},h(){c(e,"class","language-undefined")},m(t,n){p(t,e,n),e.innerHTML=s},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&o(e)}}}const w={title:"Love Potion Number Nine"};class y extends d{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,k,l,{})}}export{y as default,w as metadata};
