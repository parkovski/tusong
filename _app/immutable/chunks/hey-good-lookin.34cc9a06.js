Hey sweet baby don&#39;t ya think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe 
 
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There&#39;s soda pop and the dancin&#39;s free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me
 
Say Hey Good Lookin&#39; whatcha got cookin
How&#39;s about cookin somethin&#39; up with me

I&#39;m free and ready so we can go steady
How about saving all your time for me 
No more lookin&#39; I know I&#39;ve been tooken
How about keepin&#39; steady company 
 
I&#39;m gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents 
I&#39;ll keep it &#39;til it&#39;s covered with age
Cause I&#39;m writin&#39; your name down on every page 
Say Hey Good Lookin&#39; whatcha got cooking,
