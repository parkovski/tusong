 All I need is a little air, some for me some for everywhere
 A Little Lo--ve,    Oh a Little Lo--ve,
Just a little lo--ve,  A little bit of lo--ve

All I need is some water to drink, 
a quiet place where I can sit &amp; think
And if I find a pot of gold, I’ll never forget about the rainbow
 A Little Love,    Oh a Little Love,
 Just a little love,  A little bit of love

But really what I’m trying to say, is I need you
 And every little bit of love you give me too  oo

All I need is a happy home,some place I wouldn’t have to be alone
Well It’d be nice to have some candle light, 
to light the fire in your heart at night
  A Little L--ove,    Oh a Little Lo--ve,
  Just a little love,  A little bit of love</code>`;return{c(){e=d("pre"),this.h()},l(t){e=v(t,"PRE",{class:!0});var l=f(e);l.forEach(a),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","language-undefined")},m(t,l){m(t,e,l),e.innerHTML=n},p:o,i:o,o,d(t){t&&a(e)}}}const p={title:"Little Bit of Love"};class g extends s{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,c,h,{})}}export{g as default,p as metadata};
