And it’s a good day for singin’ along
Yes, it’ a good day, how could anything go wrong,
A good day from mornin’ till night.

Yes it’s a good day for shinin’your shoes,
And it’s a good day for losin’ the blues
Everything to gain and nothin’ to lose,
It’s  a good day from mornin’  till night

I said to the sun, good mornin’ sun
Rise and shine today, you know you’ve gotta get goin’
If you’re gonna make a showin’
And you know you’ve got the right of way

Cause it’s a good day for payin’ you bills
And it’s a good day for curin’ your ills;
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,
Cause it’s a good day from mornin’ till night</code>`;return{c(){o=g("pre"),this.h()},l(a){o=u(a,"PRE",{class:!0});var n=h(o);n.forEach(e),this.h()},h(){y(o,"class","language-undefined")},m(a,n){f(a,o,n),o.innerHTML=i},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(a){a&&e(o)}}}const p={title:"It's a Good Day"};class _ extends d{constructor(o){super(),r(this,o,null,c,l,{})}}export{_ as default,p as metadata};
