Let me ride through the wide-open country that I love;
don’t fence me in. 
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze, 
listen to the mur-mur of the cottonwood trees.
send me off forever, but I ask you please, don’t fence me in.  
 
Just turn run me loose let me straddle my old saddle 
Underneath the western skies. 

On my cay-use, let me wander over yonder til I see the mountains rise--e.

gaze at the moon til I lose my senses,
can’t look at hobbles, and I can’t stand fences;   
don’t fence me in.</code>`;return{c(){e=m("pre"),this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"PRE",{class:!0});var n=h(e);n.forEach(a),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","language-undefined")},m(t,n){f(t,e,n),e.innerHTML=r},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&a(e)}}}const g={title:"Don't Fence Me In"};class _ extends l{constructor(e){super(),d(this,e,null,p,i,{})}}export{_ as default,g as metadata};
