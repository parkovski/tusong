To a home on God&#39;s celestial shore, I&#39;ll fly away

I&#39;ll fly away, oh glory, I&#39;ll fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by, I&#39;ll fly away

When the shadows of this life have gone, I&#39;ll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I&#39;ll fly, I&#39;ll fly away

Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I&#39;ll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I&#39;ll fly away (Chorus)

Just a few more weary days and then, I&#39;ll fly away
To a land where joys will never end, I&#39;ll fly away.
