A little rain is gonna come and go
But I don&#39;t need sunny skies to sing about you.

I&#39;m like the birds up in the trees
With an endless store of melodies
And I don&#39;t need sunny skies to sing about you.

I&#39;d sing about your laughing eyes, the way they fill the room
The way you&#39;re lighting the sky upon this rainy afternoon

Aw, thanks for the flowers, thanks for the smile
I&#39;m gonna sit and play my guitar for a while
I don&#39;t need sunny skies to sing about you.

I&#39;d sing about your dancing feet, the way you jump and spin
The way you open the door and let this world waltz right on in

Here&#39;s a tune to say I love you so,
