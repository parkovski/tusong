Cos there&#39;s a place in the sun, where there&#39;s hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart&#39;s gotta run.
There&#39;s a place in the sun, and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like this tired, troubled earth, I&#39;ve been rollin&#39; since my birth; movin&#39; on, movin&#39; on</code>`;return{c(){e=c("pre"),this.h()},l(n){e=d(n,"PRE",{class:!0});var a=m(e);a.forEach(o),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","language-undefined")},m(n,a){p(n,e,a),e.innerHTML=s},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(n){n&&o(e)}}}const _={title:"A Place in the Sun"};class g extends i{constructor(e){super(),l(this,e,null,f,h,{})}}export{g as default,_ as metadata};
