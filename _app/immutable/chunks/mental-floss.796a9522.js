They don&#39;t walk and they don&#39;t talk with some Euro-trash accent
They&#39;re just simple protoplasm clear as cellophane
They ride the winds of fortune, life without a brain

And send me seeking shelter beneath my mosquito net
I stay there for hours protected from the night
All those insects and vipers and other things that bite.</code>`;return{c(){e=d("pre"),this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"PRE",{class:!0});var s=m(e);s.forEach(n),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","language-undefined")},m(t,s){p(t,e,s),e.innerHTML=l},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&n(e)}}}const g={title:"Mental Floss"};class _ extends r{constructor(e){super(),i(this,e,null,f,h,{})}}export{_ as default,g as metadata};
