<h1>Singalong Songs</h1>

<pre>1.     		A PLACE IN THE SUN

Like a long lonely stream, I keep runnin towards a dream
Movin on, Movin on
Like a branch on a tree, keep reachin to be free; Movin on Movin on

Cos there’s a place in the sun, where there’s hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart’s gotta run.
There’s a place in the sun, and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road, I get weary from the load; Movin on Movin on
Like this tired, troubled earth, I’ve been rollin since by birth;
Movin on Movin on.


2.			AIN’T WE GOT FUN

Every Morning, every evening  ain’t we got fun?
Not much money, Oh, but honey ain’t we got fun?
The rent’s unpaid, dear we haven’t car
but anyway dear we’ll stay as we are.

Even if we, owe the grocer, don’t we have fun
Tax collectors, getting closer. still we have fun
There’s nothing   surr-er,
the rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the mean time in between time don’t we got fun


3.			DON’T FENCE ME IN

Oh give me land, lots of land under starry skies above,
don’t fence me in.
Let me ride through the wide-open country that I love;
don’t fence me in.
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze,
listen to the mur-mur of the cottonwood trees.
send me off forever, but I ask you please, don’t fence me in.

Just turn run me loose let me straddle my old saddle
underneath the western skies.

On my cay-use, let me wander over yonder til I see the mountains rise--e.
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences,
gaze at the moon til I lose my senses,
can’t look at hobbles, and I can’t stand fences;
don’t fence me in.




4.			DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY

HERE’S A LITTLE SONG I WROTE
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SING IT NOTE FOR NOTE.  DON’T WORRY,  BE HAPPY
IN EVERY LIFE WE HAVE SOME TROUBLE
WHEN YOU WORRY YOU MAKE IT DOUBLE.  DON’T WORRY,  BE HAPPY,  LA LA

AIN’T GOT NO PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD
SOMEONE CAME AND TOOK YOUR BED   DON’T WORRY,  BE HAPPY
LANDLORD SAY YOU’RE RENT IS LATE
HE MAY HAVE TO LITIGATE.   DON’T WORRY,   BE HAPPY.  LA LA LA

AIN’T GOT NO CASH, AIN’T GOT NO STYLE
AIN’T GOT NO GAL TO MAKE YOU SMILE.  DON’T WORRY  BE HAPPY
CUZ WHEN YOU WORRY, YOU FACE WILL FROWN
AND THAT WILL BRING EVERYDODY DOWN.  DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY. LA LA

5.			EVERY LITTLE CELL

Every little cell in my body is happy
Every little cell in my body is well  (2x)
I’m so glad, every little cell in my body is happy and well. 2x

Every little thought in my mind is fleeting
Every little thought in my mind goes by  2x
I’m so glad, every little thought in my mind is really not. 2x

6.			HEY GOOD LOOKIN

Hey Good Lookin&#39; whatcha got cookin
How&#39;s about cookin somethin&#39; up with me
Hey sweet baby don&#39;t ya think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There&#39;s soda pop and the dancin&#39;s free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Say Hey Good Lookin&#39; whatcha got cookin
How&#39;s about cookin somethin&#39; up with me

I&#39;m free and ready so we can go steady
How about saving all your time for me
No more lookin&#39; I know I&#39;ve been tooken
How about keepin&#39; steady company

I&#39;m gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents
I&#39;ll keep it &#39;til it&#39;s covered with age
Cause I&#39;m writin&#39; your name down on every page
Say Hey Good Lookin&#39; whatcha got cooking,
How’s about cookin something up with me
7.			I BELIEVE IN MUSIC

I could just sit around, making music all day long.
As long as I’m making my music ain’t gonna do nobody no harm
And who knows, maybe someday, I’ll come up with a song
To make people want to stop this fussing and fighting
Long enough to sing along.

I believe in music.  I believe in love
I believe in music.  I believe in Love

Music is love and love is music If you know what I mean
People who believe in music are the happiest people I’ve ever seen
So clap you hands and stomp your feet and shake those tambourines
Lift your voices to the sky, God loves you when you sing.  I believe

Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To peace and hope and understanding, and living in harmony
So take your brother by the hand and come along with me
Find out what it really means to be rich and young and free I believe


8.			I DON’T NEED SUNNY SKIES

Hey there, duchess, don’t you know
A little rain is gonna come and go
But I don’t need sunny skies to sing about you.

I’m like the birds up in the trees
With an endless store of melodies
And I don’t need sunny skies to sing about you

I’d sing about your laughing eyes, The way they fill the room
The way you’re lighting the sky upon this rainy afternoon

Aw, Thanks for the flowers, thanks for the smile
I’m gonna sit and play my guitar for a while
I don’t need sunny skies to sing about you.

I’d sing about your dancing feet, the way you jump and spin
The way you open the door and let this world waltz right on in

Hey there duchess, don’t you know, here’s a tune to say I love you so, and I don’t need sunny skies to sing about you, Oh.. 3x


9.			I’LL FLY AWAY

Some bright morning when this life is over, I’ll fly away
To a home on gods celestial shore, I’ll fly away

I’ll fly aaway, oh glory, I’ll fly away
When I die Hallelujah by and by, I’ll fly a-way

When the shadows of this life have gone, I’ll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I’ll fly, I’ll fly away

Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I’ll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I’ll fly away (Chorus)

Just a few more weary days and then, I’ll fly away
To a land where joys will never end, I’ll fly away. (Chorus)


10.			I WALK THE LINE

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you&#39;re mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a fool for you
Because you&#39;re mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I&#39;ve known proves that it&#39;s right
Because you&#39;re mine, I walk the line

You&#39;ve got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can&#39;t hide
For you I know I&#39;d even try to turn the tide
Because you&#39;re mine, I walk the line   (back to Verse 1)








11.			IT’S A GOOD DAY

Yes it’s a good day for singin’ a song
And it’s a good day for singin’ along
Yes, it’ a good day, how could anything go wrong,
A good day from mornin’ till night.

Yes it’s a good day for shinin’your shoes,
And it’s a good day for losin’ the blues
Everything to gain and nothin’ to lose,
It’s  a good day from mornin’  till night

I said to the sun, good mornin’ sun
Rise and shine today, you know you’ve gotta get goin’
If you’re gonna make a showin’
And you know you’ve got the right of way

Cause it’s a good day for payin’ you bills
And it’s a good day for curin’ your ills;
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,
Cause it’s a good day from mornin’  till night

(JAMBALAYA, NEXT PAGE)


12.			LITTLE BIT OF LOVE

 All I need is a little sun, some for me some for every one
 All I need is a little air, some for me some for everywhere
 A Little Love,    Oh a Little Love,
Just a little love,  A little bit of love

All I need is some water to drink,
a quiet place where I can sit &amp; think
And if I find a pot of gold, I’ll never forget about the rainbow
 A Little Love,    Oh a Little Love,
 Just a little love,  A little bit of love

But really what I’m trying to say, is I need you
  And every little bit of love you give me too  oo

All I need is a happy home, some place I wouldn’t have to be alone
Well It’d be nice to have some candle light,
to light the fire in your heart at night
  A Little Love,    Oh a Little Love,
  Just a little love,  A little bit of love







13.			JAMBALAYA

Goodbye Joe me gotta go me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne the sweetest one me oh my oh
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun o the bayou

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filet gumbo
‘Cause tonight I’m gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of a gun we’ll have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin.
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, me on my oh
Son of me gun we’ll have big fun on the bayou

14.			LOVE POTION NUMBER NINE

I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth.
She’s got a pad down on thirty-fourth and Vine.
Sellin’ little bottles of: Love Potion Number Nine.

I told here that I was a flop with chics.
I’ve been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said What you need was : Love Potion Number Nine.

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink.
She said I’m gonna make it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian Ink.
I held my nose and closed my eyes and I took a drink.

I didn’t know if it was day or night.
I started kissin’ every thing in sight.
But when I kissed a cop down at Thirty-Fourth and Vine
She broke my little bottle of:  Love Potion number nine.

15.			L-O-V-E

 L,  is  for the way you  look at  me
 O,  is for the only one I see
 V,  is very, very, extraordinary …
 E,  is even more than Anyone that you  adore and

Love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it, take my heart but please don’t break it
Love was made for me and you. Love was made for me and you



16.			MENTAL FLOSS

I&#39;d like to be a jellyfish  &#39;Cause jellyfish don&#39;t pay rent
They don&#39;t walk and they don&#39;t talk with some Euro-blast accent
They&#39;re just simple protoplasm Clear as cellophane
They ride the winds of fortune, life without a brain

In one ear and out the other, Don&#39;t you get criss-crossed
I recommend you try a little mental floss

It&#39;s the small, small problems, That keep me so upset
And send me seeking shelter beneath my mosquito net
I stay there for hours protected from the night
All those insects and vipers and other things that bite



17.			O LONESOME ME!

Everybody’s goin’ out and havin fun.
I’m just a fool for stayin’ home and havin’ none.
I can’t get over how she set me free.    Oh...lonesome me.
A bad mistake I’m makin’ by just hanging ‘round.
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town.
A lovesick fool that’s blind and just can’t see.  Oh, lonesome me.

*I’ll bet she’s not like me, she’s out and fancy free,
flirting with the boys with all her charms.
But I still love her so, and brother don’t you know,
I’d welcome her right back here in my arms.

Well, there must be someway I can lose these lonesome blues.
Forget about the past and find some body new.
I’ve thought of everything from A to Z.   Oh, lonesome me....*



18.			ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET

Grab your coat, and get your hat, leave your worries on the
door-step. Just direct you feet to the Sunny side of the street

Can’t you hear a pitter pat, and that happy tune is your step.
Life can be so sweet on the Sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade,
But I’m not afraid, this rover crossed over.

If I never have a cent, I’ll be rich as Rockefeller.
Gold dust at my feet, on the Sunny side of the street.


19.             PUT A LITTLE LOVE IN YOUR HEART

Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand,
Put a little love in your heart.
You see it&#39;s getting late, Oh, please don&#39;t hesitate,
Put a little love in you heart
And the world will be a better place, And the world will be a better place,  For you  and  me,  Just  wait  and  see.

Another day goes by and still the children cry;
Put a little love in your heart.
Take a good look around, and if you’re lookin down,
Put a little love in your heart.  And the world will be a………

If you want the world to know, we won&#39;t let hatred grow,
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide, kindness will be your guide,
Put a little love in your heart.  And the world will be a ……
Put a little love in your heart.  3X

20.			SIDE BY SIDE

Oh! We ain’t got a bar-el of mon-ey, Maybe we’re ragged and funny
But we’ll travel along singin a song, Side by Side

Don’t know what’s comin tomorrow, Maybe it’s trouble and sorrow
But we’ll travel the road, sharin our load. Side by Side

*Through all kinds of weather, what if the sky should fall
Just as long as we’re together, it really doesn’t matter at all

When they’ve all had their quarrels and parted.
Well be the same as we started.   Just travelin along singing a song,  Side by side   *Through all kinds of wheater….


21.			STAND BY ME

When the night has come, and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we’ll see
No, I won’t be afraid, Oh, I won’t be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

Oh Stand by me.  Oh oh stand by me stand by me

If the sky that we look upon, should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won’t cry, I won’t cry, No I won’t shed a tear,
just as long as you stand by me

Oh darling darlin stand by me
Oh oh stand by me, stand by me stand by me stand by me
Whenever you’re in trouble, Won’t you stand by me
22.			SUGAR-TOWN

 I GOT SOME TROUBLES BUT THEY WON’T LAST
 I’M GONNA LAY RIGHT DOWN HERE IN THE GRASS
 AND PRETTY SOON ALL MY TROUBLES WILL PASS
 CAUSE I’M IN  SU…SU…SU. SU…SU…SU… SUSUSUSU SUGAR TOWN  OH!

I NEVER HAD A DOG THAT LIKED ME SOME
I NEVER HAD A FRIEND THAT WANTED ONE
SO I JUST LAY BACK AND LAUGH AT THE SUN
CAUSE I’M IN  SU SU… SU….SU… SU…   SUGAR TOWN  OH!

YESTER DAY IT RAINED IN TENNESSEE
I HEARD IT ALSO RAINED IN TALLAHASEE
BUT NOT A DROP FELL ON LITTLE OLE ME
CAUSE I’M IN  SU… SU… SU….SU…SU… SUGAR TOWN    OH!

IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS OR TEN
I’d GIVE IT TO YOU WORLD AND THEN
YOU’D GO AWAY AND LET ME SPEND
MY LIFE IN SU…   SU…SU…………….SUGAR TOWN….OH!

23.			SWEET HAPPY LIFE

My wish for you, sweet happy life
May all the days of the year that you live be laughing  days.
With all my heart,  sweet happy life.
And may the night times that follow the days be dancing lights

 Stars for your smile,  moons for your hair
And someone’s wonderful love for your loving  heart to  share

My wish for you,  sweet happy  life
May all your sorrows be gone and your heart begin to sing.
And if a wish can make it be, I wish to spend everyday of your happy life with me.      Sweet Happy Life,     Sweet Happy Life

24.			THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND

This land is your land, This land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
 This land was made for you and  me.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me.    CHORUS

I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
to the sparkling  sands of her diamond deserts
While all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and  me.   CHORUS
This land is your land, cont.
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
A voice was chanting, as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me.


25.			THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE

This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine
This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine
This Little Light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine
Let it shine Let it shine Let it shine
(All around the world; My brothers my sisters; This be love of ours;
From my heart to yours; Hide it under a cactus; In darkness and light)

26.			THREE LITTLE BIRDS

Don’t worry about a thing,
cause every little thing, gonna be all right.
Singin, don’t worry about a thing
cause every little thing, gonna be all right.

Rise up this nornin, Smile with the risin sun,
Three little birds, Pitch by my doorstep
Singin Sweet songs. Of melodies pure and true,
Sayin, This is my message to you

27.			TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME

I KNOW YOU BELOoooNG TO SOMEBODY NEW
BUT TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME

ALTHOUGH WE’RE APART, YOU’RE A PART OF MY HEART
AND TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME

WAY DOWN BY THE STREAM; HOW SWEET IT WOULD SEEM
ONCE MORE JUST TO DREAM IN THE MOON LIGHT

MY HONEY I KNOW WITH THE DAWN, THAT YOU WILL BE GONE
AND TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME, JUST TO LITTLE OLE ME.


28.			WE’RE GONNA SING:
 *Zipper song, we replace sing with A new word

You gotta Sing when the spirit says Sing
You gotta sing when the spirit says sing.
When your spirit says sing you gotta sing right along.
You gotta sing when your spirit says sing
